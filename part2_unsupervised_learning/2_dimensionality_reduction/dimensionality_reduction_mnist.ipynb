    "\n",
    "1. **Import and Understand a Dataset**: Learn how to load, preprocess, and explore a dataset to prepare it for training.\n",
    "2. **Perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset**: Learn to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a 2D dataset for better visualisation.\n",
    "3. **Train a classification model**: Select and train a classification model using scikit-learn.\n",
    "4. **Evaluate and plot the model performance**: Select a criterion to which you can evaluate the model, and plot its result.\n",
    "5. **Compare multiple classification model, and get the best performance**: Compare multiple models, and find the best model to fit the data.\n",
